## Installation
### Prerequisites
### Directory Structure
Ensure that you have a file and folder structure as follows:
```
root/
├── container-repo/
│ ├── workdir/
│ └── docker-compose.yml
```
### Installing
### Starting the Containers
Position yourself in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the desired directory.

```
cd container-repo
```
Start the Docker containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file with the command:
```
docker-compose up
```
To start the containers in detached mode (in the background), use the -d flag:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
This will launch an instance of the application, connected to a database already populated with test information.
### Checking Container Status
Verify the status of the started containers by executing the command:
```
docker-compose ps
```
### Stopping and Removing Containers
To stop and remove the containers, networks, and volumes associated with the definitions in the docker-compose.yml file, use the command:
```
docker-compose down
```
